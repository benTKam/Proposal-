# Proposal-
Proposal for final project with group Python 
Difficulties we faced, and overcame:

Some difficulties we had were Figuring the scoreboard, making defenders, changing volume for background music, adding a red ring around the frisbee and making it a circle, placement for lines on field, creating people as paddles, hit box on paddles, every time you hit a paddle you score a point. 

Differences from original:

We did not add defenders because it was too random for the frisbee to be intercepted making the game pointless and more difficult, so we added other features instead like better sounds and music, updating the hit boxes on the characters, designing the field and adding graphics to the field, and high score feature was added. We focused more on design to replace the defenders. 

Thing we enjoyed:

Working together as a group was fun as we had all known each other previously from temple ultimate frisbee so it was cool to create a game about the sport we met over. Playing a game that you had a part in creating is also a fun experience. The music and in game sounds we added are pretty fun as well adding some much needed sound.
