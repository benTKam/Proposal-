Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Weve managed to code the AI for the oppsoing player so that when activated the AI controls the second paddle and the player can play the game by themselves. WEll be using this AI in our project to control the other "player" that the user will be throwing the frisbee too. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?
We still need to add more touchies to increase the frsibee-ness of the game. such as inreasing the size of the frisbee adding sound effects and a defender or two to incrase the difficulty. We're also considering altering the apperance of the players to actually make them look like people to improve the quality of the game. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Weve gone back and forth on how to deteermine if the user wins or not, as the AI makes it pretty much impossible to actually with the the level its coded at now. TO solve this we are considering making the points of the game not to throw the disc past the other player, but to keep the throw going for as long as possible with a large clock keeping the time adn the point of the game to get the longest time possible. Another alternative is having the players score increase every time the disc bounces of one of the players with the highest possible score being the goal.
